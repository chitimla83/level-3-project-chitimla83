Explanation of project:
The project that i have built is the Craighead Sports Portal, a page that was created with the intentions of conveying information about sports to the intended users. There are multiple pages that can be easily navigated through the nav bar. With that on every page there are subpages that help the user acess their desired information. These subpages are mainly conveyed to the users as buttons.

Code used:
CSS,Bulma and HTML

Below includes the ways to matain my webapp which is the the Craighead sports portal.

The code is stored under my Github account as "level 3-project"
Github is used to make updates (commits) and is the main version control - this flows into VS code where the code can easily be updated
VS Code is where updates of the code are made - saving those and making comments on the updates made can be done throught github (commits as mentioned before because they are connected)
In order to intsall the the pacakage open a terminal and use 'npm install'
To open up the webapp on a browser use "npm run dev" - this should be done everytime you close a terminal and would like to open up the webapp in a browser
The 4 main coponents Header, Footer, Nav and Image are all stored under the lib folder - any updates made on those pages will be made across all pages
if any other changes to the layout are wanted this page can be found on the layout page under routes
Under the routes folder there is acess to all of the subpages for each pf the sports and the 3 main pages (Home-page.svelte and the rest under the appropriate name)
All images are stored in the static folder and if any photos are desired simply add them to the folder and proceed

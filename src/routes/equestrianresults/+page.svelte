    Members of the Craighead Equestrian team recently competed in the Secondary Schools Canterbury One Day Event at McLeans Island. We had two teams â€“ CDS Blue Cate Lightbourne, Lydia Hanrahan, Sophie Smith and Annabel Murray and CDS Green which was also a composite team of Abi Hyslop, Poppy Slater and riders from Middleton Grange and Riccarton High.
    <br />
    Congratulations to the CDS Green Team of Abi Hyslop, Poppy Slater, Mischa Vaughan ( R. H.S) and Nicole Irving ( M.G) on coming 5th overall. Some excellent dressage and cross country riding in what was a very wet, cold and trying day.
    <br />
    CDS Blue started well and Cate Lightbourne and Sophie Smith finished the day on their dressage scores but the cross-country component was not to be for Lydia Hanrahan and Annabel Murray, resulting in eliminations.

  <h1>Badminton Results</h1>
  <br />
  <p>This Tuesday saw the end of the 2022 Timaru Secondary Schools Badminton Competition. This year has been another successful year for Craighead Badminton. We had a lot of new players sign up, taking our total number of teams from 7 last year up to 12 this year. In the final week of play, we were competing in some big matches. While we did not win them all, we did still get some excellent results to finish off a great season.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Some of the key results were:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Junior CDS 3 won the Junior Girls Division. This team consisted of Honour Andrews, Islabelle Taylor, Ruby Gordon, and Annabelle Talbot. They had the assistance of Riley Pawsey helping out in the final as a substitute. Even more impressive with this being their first year playing!</li>
    <li>Senior CDS 2 were runners-up in the Senior Girls B Grade Division. This team was made up of Skye Bowen, Camryn Porter, Pear Chantrasup, and Haruka Kato.</li>
    <li>Senior CDS 6 won the Senior Girls C Grade Division. This team included Samantha Giddings, Mia Donaldson, Emma Campbell, Heather Miller, and Abby McLeod.</li>
  </ul>

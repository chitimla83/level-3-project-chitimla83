      <p>Volleyball is played on a Friday evening at the SBS Events Centre, Morgans Rd. Competition will be starting with games from 6.00pm to 8.00pm. Although teams have dedicated student coaches, we require at least one parent from each team to supervise games. A roster will be organised at the beginning of the season. It is also essential that your daughter does duty on the evenings that this is required. Without teams completing this we would not have a competition. Any teams that do not undertake their Duty requirements will be deducted competition points plus fined $50. Thank you in advance for this.</p>

  <h2>Aoraki Volleyball</h2>
  <p>
    After months of training and hard work, the Craighead Senior Volleyball teams finally had a tournament to attend being – the Aoraki Volleyball Championships. Our teams were eager to see if their skills had improved as practices had suggested.
    <br />
    Enduring four games on the trot, the Senior A team (Co Captains: Zara Coleman and Isobel Sharp, with Amalia Cabrera, Koko Kubota, Niamh Motley, Mele Manuofetoa and Camryn Porter ) swept through early pool play to face Ashburton College in the decider before the semi finals. After 10 points down in the first set, our A team rose to the challenge in the second and put their opponents under pressure. However the final outcome went in Ashburton’s favour, placing Craighead A to face the top qualifier in Pool B for the semi finals.
    <br />
    Meanwhile, in Pool B, Craighead B team (Laura Apperley, Katie Baxter, Rafaela Cabrera, Olivia Lincoln , Anna O’Sullivan, Sophie Parsons, Dinnay Phillips and Natalie Whiteley) were to create an upset rolling the Roncalli A team in a two set tussle; first set being 30-28 and the second set being 25-23 to Craighead. Administrators were consulted to calculate who qualified for the semi finals. Whilst our Craighead B Team did not get through to the semi-finals, they finished a very respectable 5th overall.
    <br />
    In the semi final round, our A team swept aside Pool B top qualifier Waitaki GHS in straight sets to set up a rematch with Ashburton College. In a reversal of dominance Craighead defeated Ashburton with a determined first and second set victory to take out the tournament.

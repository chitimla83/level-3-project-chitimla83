  <h2>Canterbury Cross Country</h2>
  <p>
    The Canterbury Secondary School Road race was held on Monday 8 May around a flat and fast track on the footpaths through North Hagley Park in Christchurch. A team of 8 girls travelled north to give themselves some early season race experience before the main cross country event at the end of May, and in June culminating in the team travelling to the NZ Secondary Schools Cross Country being held this year in Palmerston North.
    <br />
    In their first regional race at high school level, the Year 9 team of Kayla Allington, Harriet Phillips and Milla McKenzie fought back hard from a very aggressive start, with the determined Allington then gritting her way to an outstanding 5th place overall.
    <br />
    In the Junior (Under 16) girls race, the team of Ruby Laming, Georgia Bell and Kate Caird, used their experience from last year to pace themselves, the diminutive Laming showing she was not going to be pushed around by girls a year older than her, running an outstanding race to narrowly finish third in a sprint finish for second.
    <br />
    The Senior (Under 19) girls race is an exhibition of the best female runners in the wider Canterbury region, with Canterbury runners having to compete in this and the Canterbury Secondary Schools Cross Country in order to be selected for the regional relay teams at the NZSS Cross Country. For Emily Caird and Niamh Motley it was fast paced, with the vastly experienced Motley playing the chasing game beautifully, using the leading bunch to pace her, then finishing second in devastating form.
